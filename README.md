This is a test repository for learning about github

Hello! I am a developer with experience in enterprise backend applications who is venturing into web development. So I am learning about languages, practices and technologies popular in this domain.

I have used source control systems before - sourcesafe, clearquest etc. but this is my first experience with git.

So let the fun begin!
